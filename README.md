# Web-Based CCTV Surveillance with Motion Detection

### <b>Introduction</b>

This is a CCTV Security Home Surveillance WebApplication that uses </br>
motion detection to store the detected motion videos on the server.

The plan is that it should be a client server relationship where </br>
the video data is sent from the clients videocamera to the server </br>
for further proccessing.
